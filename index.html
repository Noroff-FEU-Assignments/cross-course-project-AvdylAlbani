    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advise my potential client to secure his or her website with all of the different methods of securing. There are many kinds of web security threats, but I am going to name a few of them, the likes of: cross-siting scripting, SQL injection and Cross-Site request forgery.

      There are few things we as front-end developmens can do to prevent this kind of threats. Some of the things we can do is taking in use some of the methods that I am going to mention: 
      
      sanitization of data, this method help us ensuring that the data a system accepts is in right format. This can be done manually or by using for example NodeJS. 
      
      an other method is to secure authorization and authentication, this methods help us make authorization and authentication hard to crack. This can also be done manually, but the best method is by using a open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin as we in norrof have in use. 
      
      So in summary, we have different threats and different methods of protecting this kinds of threat as mention in the text.</p>
